This project involves the construction of a program using C++ and the Constraint Programming tools that the Gecode library provides to solve the NOR Logic Synthesis Problem. You can find a full description of the problem in the file: __problemStatement.pdf__.

The pdf file __projectReport.pdf__ has a description of the constraints involved in the problem, and the files included.

The directory __instances__ has a collection of instances that the program must solve. However, for this project only instances with at most 3 variables can be solved. Read __projectReport.pdf__ for more details on how to expand this behavior.

This is a introductory and exploratory project into the field.
